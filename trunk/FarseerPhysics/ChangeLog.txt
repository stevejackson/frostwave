FarseerPhysics 1.0.0.3
----------------------
-SMALL BREAKING CHANGE (eassy to fix up)
--Added a FrictionType property to PhysicsSimulator. You can now choose between FrictionType.Minimum and FrictionType.Average. The first will cause the fiction between 2 bodies to be the min of the two, the second will use the average. In previous versions only minimum was used. Now the engine defaults to use average. If you want the engine to work the way it has been, simply set this property to minimum.
-Added BioSlayers fix to SelectiveSweep.
-Changed the Arbiter to take a PhysicsSimulator rather than a bunch of fields. All the fields were in the PhysicsSimulator.

FarseerPhysics 1.0.0.2
-----------------------
-BREAKING CHANGES
--Changed Body.GetVelocityAtPoint to Body.GetVelocityAtLocalPoint.  This was to differentiate if from the new method Body.GetVelocityAtWorldPoint


-Added Body.GetVelocityAtWorldPoint and Body.ApplyForceAtWorldPoint methods.
-Update Broadphase Collision As follows:
--Add IBroadPhaseCollider interface
--Created a BruteForceCollider that implements IBroadPhaseCollider.
--Added SweepAndPruneCollider that implements IBroadPhaseCollider (Thanks Andy Jones)
--Added SelectiveSweepCollider that implements IBroadPhaseCollider (Thanks BioSlayer)
--Made SelectiveSweepCollider the default. While I found the SweepAndPruneCollider faster in most cases, SelectiveSweep seems for forgiving in general situations.
--Added SetBroadPhaseCollider(IBroadPhaseCollider) to PhysicsSimulator.
--All the broad phase stuff is still somewhat in flux. It could change again in the future.

-Added a Demo8: Broad Phase Collision Stress Test.
-Renamed Calculator.PiX2 to Calculator.TwoPi to be consistent with XNS math library.
-Added FluidDragController to simulate rigid bodies in water or other liquids.
-Added a number of LineIntersection methods. Used to test intersection two lines or lines an Geoms. The methods can be found in the new CollisionHelper class. (Thanks to Jeremy Bell for the code.)


FarseerPhysics 1.0.0.1
-----------------------
BREAKING CHANGE:
-Geometry object name was changed to Geom. I know this might cause some temporay headaches but 'Geometry' conflicts with a Geometry object in Silverlight and long term I think this is the right decision.

-PhysicsSimulator
 Added new SweepAndPrune BroadPhaseCollision option. This option can be toggled by setting PhysicsSimulator.BroadPhaseCollider. 
 Default is brute force until SweepAndPrune can be optimized.

-PhysicsSimulator.ProcessRemovedItems: 
Added code to remove any arbiters associated with geometries that are being removed from the simulator.

-PhysicsSimulator.ProcessAddedItems:
Changed the order the ProcessXXX methods were called.  Put ProcessAddedItems 1st to avoid confusion when add/remove is called without calling update in between.

-Mathematics.Calculator:
Added DegreesToRadians method.

-Collision.Vertices
 Added CalculateMomentOfInertia() to make it easy to get the moment of inertia for a polygon
 Fixed a nasty collision bug that would appear with semi-complex geometries.
 
 -Global
 Did some performance tuning by replacing some existing method calls with inline logic.
 
 -RevoluteJoint
 Changed default biasFactor to .2 from .8.  For stability purposes.
 
 -Body
 Changed the ApplyImpulse logic to store impulses applied externally and have the PhysicsSimulator apply the summed impules all at once.
 Joints and Arbiter now call internal method "ApplyImmediateImpulse"
