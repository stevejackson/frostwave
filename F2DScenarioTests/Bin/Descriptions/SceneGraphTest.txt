* the graphic for each cell (if rendered), test.png
* One world image is loaded for each cell, test2.png
* One screen image is loaded, the smiley.png to the right
* one smiley is loaded as a world image, 
	the SceneGraph's parentcell will always be assigned to this object's curCell, 
	assuming it's on the screen.

* Controls:
	WASD = move the neighbourcells
	Arrow keys = move the world object smiley
	Enter = resize and re-initialize the grid, to a slightly smaller size
	            this is only to simulate a screen change which comes along with a grid size change.
	Space = (this key is really touchy, so just tap it) toggles the rendering of cells
